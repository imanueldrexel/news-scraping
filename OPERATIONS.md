## Running Tasks

All tasks are dispatched via `lambda_handler.process_event(event, None)`:

### Crawl a website (sitemap + articles)
```python
from newscrawler.application.api.lambda_function import lambda_handler
lambda_handler.process_event({"task": "all", "website": "BISNIS"}, None)
# Multiple websites:
lambda_handler.process_event({"task": "all", "website": "BISNIS,KOMPAS,CNBC"}, None)
```

### Knowledge extraction (Phase 2)
```python
lambda_handler.process_event({"task": "extract_knowledge"}, None)
```
Processes up to 50 unextracted articles per run. Safe to run repeatedly.

### Newsletter generation (Phase 3)
```python
lambda_handler.process_event({"task": "newsletter"}, None)
```
Generates today's digest to `digests/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

To regenerate a specific past date, call directly:
```python
from datetime import date
from newscrawler.infrastructure.network.clients.sqlalchemy_client import SQLAlchemyClient
from newscrawler.infrastructure.datasource.dataflow.write.sqlalchemy.sql_alchemy_newsletter_data_source import SQLAlchemyNewsletterDataSource
from newscrawler.core.newsletter_generator import NewsletterGenerator

ds = SQLAlchemyNewsletterDataSource(SQLAlchemyClient())
gen = NewsletterGenerator(ds)
gen.generate(target_date=date(2026, 5, 20))
```

### RAG Search Web UI (Phase 4)
```bash
uvicorn newscrawler.web.app:app --port 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

### Knowledge Base CLI query (Phase 2)
```bash
python -m newscrawler.tools.kb_query --ticker BBCA --days 30
python -m newscrawler.tools.kb_query --entity "Bank Indonesia" --days 7
python -m newscrawler.tools.kb_query --ticker GOTO --format json --output goto.json
```

## Recommended Schedule (Windows Task Scheduler)

| Time (WIB) | Task | Command |
|---|---|---|
| 05:30 | Crawler health check (OPS-01) | `scripts/run_scheduled_health_check.py` — registered, see below |
| 06:00 | Morning crawl | `python __main__.py` (task=all) |
| 06:45 | Knowledge extraction | task=extract_knowledge |
| 07:00 | Newsletter | task=newsletter |
| 18:00 | Evening crawl | task=all |
| 18:45 | Knowledge extraction | task=extract_knowledge |

### Crawler health check (OPS-01)

Registered as a Task Scheduler job named **"NewsAggregator Crawler Health Check"**, daily at 05:30 (`schtasks /Query /TN "NewsAggregator Crawler Health Check" /FO LIST /V` to inspect). It runs `scripts/run_scheduled_health_check.py`, which:
1. Runs `scripts/check_crawlers.py --quiet --log-db` (exit 0 = all healthy, 1 = one or more BROKEN/PARTIAL/ERROR; also appends a `crawl_log` row per outlet and writes the dated JSON report to `crawler_health/`).
2. On exit 1, sends a Telegram notification with the one-line summary via `scripts/notify_telegram.py`.
3. Exits with `check_crawlers.py`'s own code, so the task's "Last Run Result" in Task Scheduler reflects the real outcome independent of whether the notification succeeded.

**Telegram setup** (notifications are silently skipped, logged only, until this is done):
1. In Telegram, message **@BotFather**, send `/newbot`, follow the prompts — gives a bot token.
2. Message your new bot anything so it has a conversation with you.
3. Visit `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates` in a browser, find `"chat":{"id": ...}` — that's your chat ID.
4. Add to `.env`: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=...`.
5. Test with `venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\notify_telegram.py "test message"`.

To re-create or modify the task: `schtasks /Delete /TN "NewsAggregator Crawler Health Check" /F` then re-run the `schtasks /Create` command in `scripts/run_scheduled_health_check.py`'s docstring.

## Monitoring & Health Checks

### Check API quota usage
```sql
SELECT log_date, api_name, call_count
FROM api_usage_log
ORDER BY log_date DESC
LIMIT 7;
```
Stop at 1,400 calls/day (hard-coded guard). If limit is hit frequently, reduce `KNOWLEDGE_BATCH_SIZE`.

### Check crawl health
```sql
SELECT website, task, status, article_count, error_msg,
       started_at, finished_at,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (finished_at - started_at)) AS duration_sec
FROM crawl_log
ORDER BY started_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
Red flags: `status='failed'`, `article_count=0` for a source that normally produces articles.

### Check which extractor is actually producing article text (OPS-02)
```sql
SELECT s.sources, a.meta_data->>'extractor' AS extractor, COUNT(*)
FROM articles a JOIN sitemaps s ON s.sitemap_id = a.sitemap_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 3 DESC;
```
Only populated for articles crawled after OPS-02 landed (2026-09-16) — older rows show `NULL`, since the field wasn't recorded before. A source where every row is `trafilatura`/`newspaper` and none is `site` means the site's own selector is dead even though `check_crawlers.py` may still say `FALLBACK` (or, before this fix, a misleading `OK`) — see `scripts/check_crawlers.py`'s `FALLBACK` status.

### Check digest generation
```sql
SELECT digest_date, cluster_count, article_count, generation_ms, generated_at
FROM newsletter_digests
ORDER BY digest_date DESC
LIMIT 7;
```
If today's digest is missing after 07:30 WIB, run newsletter task manually.

### Check sitemap terminal-state distribution (SYS-16)
```sql
SELECT crawl_status, COUNT(*) AS sitemaps,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE last_crawl_attempt < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days') AS past_cooldown
FROM sitemaps
GROUP BY crawl_status
ORDER BY sitemaps DESC;
```
`rejected_filter` rows are excluded from `load_all_sitemaps` permanently (off-topic, will fail the same semantic filter again) — a large and growing `pending`+`past_cooldown` count for a source that keeps producing few articles usually means its extractor is broken (`empty_extraction`), not that it has nothing to say; check `scripts/check_crawlers.py --website <NAME>` before assuming the source has gone quiet. If `INTERESTS` or the filter threshold changes, re-run `scripts/backfill_sitemap_crawl_status.py` to reclassify — `rejected_filter` is a one-time decision, not re-evaluated automatically.

### Check articles/chunks divergence (SYS-17, OPS-04)
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS orphan_articles
FROM articles a
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM chunks c WHERE c.sitemap_id = a.sitemap_id);

SELECT COUNT(*) AS pending_embedding_chunks, COUNT(DISTINCT sitemap_id) AS affected_sitemaps
FROM chunks WHERE embedding_id IS NULL;
```
`orphan_articles` should be 0 -- an `articles` row with no `chunks` row means `save_chunk_data`'s SQL insert never landed even though the article was saved (SYS-17's exact bug: FAISS had the vectors, `chunks` did not). If nonzero, `scripts/backfill_orphan_chunks.py` repairs it by re-chunking from `articles.extracted_text` (no re-crawl needed) and reuses whatever FAISS already has. `pending_embedding_chunks` nonzero is the opposite direction (DBT-17, still open) -- a `chunks` row that was inserted but never actually embedded into FAISS.

### Check for duplicate article rows (DBT-07)
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) - COUNT(DISTINCT sitemap_id) AS duplicate_rows FROM articles;
```
Should be 0 — `articles_sitemap_id_uq` (see `scripts/migrate_articles_unique_sitemap.sql`) prevents new duplicates; a nonzero count means the unique index is missing or was dropped.

### Check entity extraction progress
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE knowledge_extracted = 0) AS pending,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE knowledge_extracted = 1) AS extracted
FROM articles;
```

### API stats endpoint
```
GET http://localhost:8000/api/stats
GET http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

## One-Time Setup (first run)

```bash
# 1. Run migrations
psql -U postgres -d newsaggregator -f scripts/migrate_phase2.sql
psql -U postgres -d newsaggregator -f scripts/migrate_phase3.sql
psql -U postgres -d newsaggregator -f scripts/migrate_phase4.sql
psql -U postgres -d newsaggregator -f scripts/migrate_phase5.sql

# 2. Set GEMINI_API_KEY
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# 3. Seed entity aliases
python scripts/seed_entity_aliases.py

# 4. Run initial crawl
python -c "
from newscrawler.application.api.lambda_function import lambda_handler
lambda_handler.process_event({'task': 'all', 'website': 'BISNIS,KOMPAS,CNBC,KONTAN,DETIK'}, None)
"

# 5. Run extraction + newsletter
python -c "
from newscrawler.application.api.lambda_function import lambda_handler
lambda_handler.process_event({'task': 'extract_knowledge'}, None)
lambda_handler.process_event({'task': 'newsletter'}, None)
"
```

## Troubleshooting

**FAISS index not found on startup**
- First run creates empty indexes automatically. Run a crawl to populate them.

**`google.generativeai` not installed**
```bash
pip install google-generativeai
```

**`fastapi`/`uvicorn` not installed**
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn jinja2 python-multipart
```

**`scikit-learn` not installed (needed for DBSCAN)**
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

**Newsletter: 0 clusters produced**
- Check `DBSCAN_EPS` — try raising to 0.35 if articles are too dissimilar.
- Check that today's articles exist: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sitemaps WHERE posted_at = YYYYMMDD;`

**RAG: FTS returns no results**
- Ensure `migrate_phase4.sql` has been run (adds `fts_vector` generated column).
- Check: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chunks WHERE fts_vector IS NOT NULL;`
